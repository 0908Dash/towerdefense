Extensive testing will be conducted to ensure the game functions correctly across all supported devices and browsers. 
This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

9.2 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
A CI/CD pipeline will be set up to automate the testing and deployment process. 
This will ensure that new features and bug fixes are rolled out quickly and reliably.
